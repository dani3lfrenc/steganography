# Steganography

With this simple Python file, you can write or read messages within images


# Some additional information

All the code work if the image extensione is "JPEG".
If you try to write or read image messages with other extensions (such as PNG), the result is the following:





![Alt text](image.png?raw=true)

As you can see, the message is present at the end but is preceded by all the hex code, resulting in not being very clear.
I'm working to use this program with all the images extensions.
